The domain consists of a rotor and stator configuration with three boundary patches: rotor, stator, and nonCouple. The rotor and stator rotate in opposite directions at 1 Hz (omega = 6.2832 rad/s). Initial pressure is set to 1e5 Pa and temperature is uniform 300K for all phases. Boundary conditions include movingWallVelocity for the rotor, noSlip for the stator, and movingWallSlipVelocity for nonCouple surfaces, with zeroGradient for temperature and phase fractions on all boundaries. Physical properties for fluids are: water (rho=1000 kg/m\u00b3, nu=3.645e-4 m\u00b2/s), mercury (rho=13529 kg/m\u00b3, nu=8.6e-4 m\u00b2/s), oil (rho=500 kg/m\u00b3, nu=5e-4 m\u00b2/s), and air (mu=1.84e-5 kg/m\u00b7s). Use PIMPLE algorithm with 1 outer corrector and 3 inner correctors. Run simulation from t=0 to t=5s with initial timestep of 1e-4s (adjustable with maxCo=0.5) and write output every 0.1s.
